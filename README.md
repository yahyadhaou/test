This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
```bash
npm i
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## index.tsx 
The Home component represents the main page of the application, displaying a list of locations and implementing pagination functionality.

Props
The Home component does not receive any props.

State
The Home component uses the following state variables:

data: An array of Location objects representing the fetched location data.
currentPage: The current page number for pagination.
totalPages: The total number of pages available for the location data.
Methods
getData()
This method is responsible for fetching the location data from the API based on the current page number. It uses the axios library to make an HTTP GET request to the Rick and Morty API. The fetched data is then stored in the data state variable, and the total number of pages is stored in the totalPages state variable.

handleBoxClick(locationName: string)
This method handles the click event on a location box. It navigates to the /products page with the locationName parameter using the router.push() method from Next.js.

CSS Styles
The component defines several CSS styles using inline styles:

containerStyles: Styles for the container that wraps the location boxes.
boxStyles: Styles for each individual location box.
paginationStyles: Styles for the pagination section.
Rendering
The Home component renders the following elements:

A container div with the containerStyles, which wraps the location boxes.
Inside the container div, it maps over the data array and renders a div for each location using the boxStyles. It displays the location name, type, dimension, and the count of residents.
If there are multiple pages (totalPages > 1), it renders the pagination section. It includes a previous button, page number buttons, and a next button. The current page is highlighted, and clicking on a button updates the currentPage state variable.
Location Type
The Location type represents the structure of a location object fetched from the API. It includes the following properties:

id (number): The unique identifier of the location.
name (string): The name of the location.
type (string): The type of the location.
dimension (string): The dimension of the location.
residents (string[]): An array of resident URLs associated with the location.
## products.tsx
The code imports required modules and components such as React, useState, axios, Image, and useRouter from the Next.js framework.

The Box component represents an individual character box with an image, name, status, and species. It uses CSS properties to style the box and name. It also includes a click handler that redirects to the /cart page with the character's ID.

The Charecter component is the main component that displays a list of characters. It utilizes state hooks to manage data and filters.

Inside the Charecter component, there are CSS styles defined for the buttons and container.

The getData function fetches character data from the Rick and Morty API based on the provided locationName.

The handleFilter function filters the character data based on the selected status and updates the rendering state accordingly.

The component renders a list of character boxes using the Box component. The data to render is based on the rendering state (filtered characters) or the original data (all characters).

## cart.tsx


Certainly! Here's the documentation for the provided code:

Cart Component
The Cart component represents a page that displays information about a specific character and other random characters from the Rick and Morty API.

allcharecter: An array of Character objects representing other random characters fetched from the API.
Methods
getData()
This method is responsible for fetching the character data for the specified id from the Rick and Morty API. It uses the axios library to make an HTTP GET request. The fetched data is then stored in the data state variable.

getallCharecter()
This method fetches random character data from the Rick and Morty API. It retrieves all characters and then filters out the character with the specified id. It selects 6 random characters from the remaining data and stores them in the allcharecter state variable.

getRandomIds(max: number, count: number): number[]
This method generates a specified number of unique random character IDs between 1 and the maximum character ID (max). It returns an array of the generated IDs.

CSS Styles

containerStyles: Styles for the container that wraps the character boxes and small boxes.
